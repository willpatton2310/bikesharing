# bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of this exercise was to use Tableau to create visualizations to support our client propose a bike-sharing business in Des Moines based upon sample data from New York City.

We used Pandas to transform some data and created a story to present our finalized data.

## Results

Our Tableau visualizations showed that:
a) There is high volume of riders - Over 2,000,000
b) Most rides are well under an hour, which means high turnover
c) There is strong participation by men and women
d) There is good traffic on all days of the week, but weekdays are particularly strong from 6am - 10am and 5pm - 8pm
e) Men and women subscibers are strong users during the week
f) Peak hours run during the day in August so there is time for maintenance at night.

## Future Analysis

For future analysis, there should be continude refinement of subscribers vs. non-subscibers.  This model will work better if the operations are tweaked to maximize recurring subscriber revenues versus one-off or occasional users.
